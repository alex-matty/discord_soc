# Discord SOC (Security Operations Center)

## 📖 Summary
This project is an experimental implementation of a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** using **Discord** as the central hub.  
All integrations are achieved through **webhooks** and custom scripts, creating a centralized place to gather, monitor, and analyze information relevant to security, research, and learning.

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to design and build a fully functional SOC dashboard inside Discord, serving as a unified source of information.  
It covers both **external intelligence** (threat feeds, CVEs, news) and **internal data** (personal monitoring, bug bounty workflows, study feeds), while also emphasizing automation and learning.

## 🗂 Project Phases
The project is structured into phases, moving from simple integrations to more complex workflows:

1. **Foundation**  
   - News feeds, CVE alerts, threat intelligence feeds, GitHub activity tracker.
2. **Internal Monitoring**  
   - Log aggregation, attack surface tracking, recon result integration, knowledge feed.
3. **Bug Bounty Workflow Automation**  
   - Recon feeders, change detection, CVE correlation, bug tracker feeds.
4. **Productivity & Study Enhancements**  
   - Daily digests, study queues, metrics dashboard.
5. **Advanced SOC Features**  
   - IOC correlation, attack simulation, anomaly detection.

## 🛠 Tools & Services
All implementations are built using **100% free services** and public APIs, including:
- **Discord Webhooks** – central integration point.
- **RSS/Atom Feeds** – cybersecurity news, blogs, and advisories.
- **Public Threat Intelligence Sources** – e.g., AbuseIPDB, PhishTank, AlienVault OTX.
- **GitHub API** – repository and workflow automation.
- **Custom Scripts** – for data collection, processing, and delivery.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is **a work in progress**. Features are added incrementally as they are developed. Expect frequent changes and new additions over time.
